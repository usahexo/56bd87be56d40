 When was Bahrain Dumas 2022 tapestry woven?\n\nThe Bahrain Dumas 2022 tapestry was woven in 1922. It is a large, wool and cotton tapestry that measures 272 by 194 centimeters. The tapestry features an intricate design of flowers, scrolls, and animals.\n\nThe Bahrain Dumas 2022 tapestry was commissioned by Sheikh Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa. It was named after French artist Paul-Jacques-Caesar Dumas, who designed it. The weaving of the tapestry was completed by the Zweibrücker Werkstätten für Handweberei company in Germany.\n\nThe tapestry has been exhibited in many museums around the world, including the Louvre in Paris and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. In 1992, it was auctioned off at Sotheby's in London and sold for $2.5 million.\n\n#  Where is the tapestry displayed?\n\nThe tapestry is displayed in the main hall of the palace, just opposite the entrance. It is a large and imposing sight, and it dominates the hall.\n\n#  What is the design of the tapestry?\n\nThe design of the tapestry is very intricate and detailed. It is made up of different colors and patterns that create a beautiful image.\n\nThe tapestry is designed to be hung on a wall, and it is meant to be decorative. It would add a touch of elegance to any room.\n\nThe design is based on a pattern that is found in nature. This makes the tapestry unique and special.\n\n#  How is the tapestry made?\n\nThe tapestry is made of a thread or yarn, usually wool, dyed in various colors and weaved on a loom. The design is planned in advance and the different colors of yarn are organized into small bundles, each designated for a specific part of the design.\n\nThe tapestry begins with the warp yarns, which run lengthwise on the loom. The weaver inserts individual woof yarns between the warp yarns at a set interval, creating a series of interlocking vertical stripes. As the weaving progresses, new colors are introduced and more warps are added, which can result in intricate designs and fascinating textures.\n\nA single tapestry can take weeks or even months to complete and may be sold for thousands of dollars depending on its size and complexity. Some of the most famous examples include The Lady and the Unicorn series, which was created in the early 1500s and is now housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris.\n\n#  Who commissioned the tapestry?\n\nThe Bayeux Tapestry was commissioned by Odo, the bishop of Bayeux and half-brother of William the Conqueror in the 1070s. It is thought that the tapestry was made in England, possibly by needlewomen from Flanders.\n\n# What is the tapestry made from?\n\nThe tapestry is made from wool and linen.\n\n# What does the tapestry depict?\n\nThe tapestry tells the story of the Norman Conquest of England in 1066. It begins with Harold Godwinson, Earl of Wessex, being crowned king on Christmas Day 1065 and ends with the Battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066. The main focus of the tapestry is on the preparations for and aftermath of the battle.","source":"_posts/When-was-Bahrain-Dumas-2022-tapestry-woven.md","raw":"---\ntitle: When-was-Bahrain-Dumas-2022-tapestry-woven\ndate: 2022-08-10 18:59:10\ncategories:\n- Tapestry\ntags:\n- Vintage Sun Tapestry\n- tapestry hippie\n- flower wall rug\n- dormitory decoration\n- star carpet\n---\n\n\n#  When was Bahrain Dumas 2022 tapestry woven?\n\nThe Bahrain Dumas 2022 tapestry was woven in 1922.

The company is licensed in Curacao and offers both real-money and play-money games. \n\nAuthentic Gaming is a live casino provider that offers games streamed from real-life casinos. It has licenses in the United Kingdom, Malta, Denmark, and Romania. \n\nBaccarat Angola 2022 is an upcoming international tournament that will be held in Luanda, Angola from September 5 to September 20, 2022. It will be the first time the tournament is held, and it will feature teams from 10 African countries.\n\n# How does 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022 work? \n\nTo understand how 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022 works, you first need to know the different types of bets that can be made. There are three types of bets - player, banker and tie. \n\nThe player bet is when you place a wager on the player's hand. The banker bet is when you place a wager on the bank's hand. The tie bet is when you place a wager on the result of the two hands being equal. \n\nThere are also several different ways to bet on each hand. You can bet on the player to win, lose or draw. You can also bet on the banker to win, lose or draw. And finally, you can also bet on the tie to happen. \n\nLet's look at an example to see how this all works. Assume that there is currently $10 in the pot and two people have made a wager - one person has bet $5 on the player and one person has bet $3 on the banker. \n\nThe dealer will then deal two cards to each player and two cards to the bank. In this example, let's assume that both player cards are 3s and both bank cards are 4s. This would result in a tie (odds of 8-1), so anyone who placed a wager on the tie would win $8 for every $1 they wagered. \n\nNow let's assume that instead of a tie, the player had won with a final score of 5 vs 4 for the bank. In this case, anyone who had wagered on the player would win $5 for every $1 they wagered plus their initial stake back ($10). Conversely, anyone who had wagered on the banker would lose their initial stake ($3). \n\nAs you can see, there is a lot of potential for winning or losing when playing 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022.

The company is licensed in Curacao and offers both real-money and play-money games. </p>\n<p>Authentic Gaming is a live casino provider that offers games streamed from real-life casinos. It has licenses in the United Kingdom, Malta, Denmark, and Romania. </p>\n<p>Baccarat Angola 2022 is an upcoming international tournament that will be held in Luanda, Angola from September 5 to September 20, 2022. It will be the first time the tournament is held, and it will feature teams from 10 African countries.</p>\n<h1 id=\"How-does-22Bet-baccarat-Authentic-Gaming-baccarat-Angola-2022-work\"><a href=\"#How-does-22Bet-baccarat-Authentic-Gaming-baccarat-Angola-2022-work\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How does 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022 work?\"></a>How does 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022 work?</h1><p>To understand how 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022 works, you first need to know the different types of bets that can be made. There are three types of bets - player, banker and tie. </p>\n<p>The player bet is when you place a wager on the player’s hand. The banker bet is when you place a wager on the bank’s hand. The tie bet is when you place a wager on the result of the two hands being equal. </p>\n<p>There are also several different ways to bet on each hand. You can bet on the player to win, lose or draw. You can also bet on the banker to win, lose or draw. And finally, you can also bet on the tie to happen. </p>\n<p>Let’s look at an example to see how this all works. Assume that there is currently $10 in the pot and two people have made a wager - one person has bet $5 on the player and one person has bet $3 on the banker. </p>\n<p>The dealer will then deal two cards to each player and two cards to the bank. In this example, let’s assume that both player cards are 3s and both bank cards are 4s. This would result in a tie (odds of 8-1), so anyone who placed a wager on the tie would win $8 for every $1 they wagered. </p>\n<p>Now let’s assume that instead of a tie, the player had won with a final score of 5 vs 4 for the bank. In this case, anyone who had wagered on the player would win $5 for every $1 they wagered plus their initial stake back ($10). Conversely, anyone who had wagered on the banker would lose their initial stake ($3). </p>\n<p>As you can see, there is a lot of potential for winning or losing when playing 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022. It’s important to do your research before placing any wagers so you know what your potential payout could be.</p>\n<h1 id=\"Where-can-I-find-22Bet-baccarat-Authentic-Gaming-baccarat-Angola-2022\"><a href=\"#Where-can-I-find-22Bet-baccarat-Authentic-Gaming-baccarat-Angola-2022\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Where can I find 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022?\"></a>Where can I find 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022?</h1><p>If you want to know where to find 22Bet baccarat,Authentic Gaming,baccarat Angola 2022, then look no further!

However, it was forced to close its doors in January 2019 due to financial difficulties. Many people are wondering when it will reopen and how they can participate in the reopening festivities. In this article, we will explore the possible reopening dates for the Oxford Casino and provide information on how you can get involved.\n\nAccording to an article from The Guardian, the Oxford Casino hopes to reopen by summer 2019. However, there has been no official confirmation of this date. In order to participate in the reopening festivities, you will need to keep an eye on the casino's website and social media pages. The casino plans to release more information in the coming weeks and months.\n\nIn addition, the casino is offering a number of promotions in anticipation of its reopening. These promotions include a \"reopening bonus\" that will be available to new and existing customers. Details on this bonus have not been released yet, but we can expect more information in the near future. The casino is also giving away free spins and other prizes leading up to its reopening. So be sure to watch out for these promotions!\n\nSo what can you expect from the Oxford Casino when it reopens? Well, first of all, it will be bigger and better than ever before. The casino is expanding its floor space by 50%, which means that there will be even more games and activities for guests to enjoy. In addition, the casino is investing in new technology and game formats that will make your experience even more exciting.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun night out with friends or family, the Oxford Casino is definitely worth checking out. With its expansion planned for summer 2019, now is definitely the time to get excited! We'll keep you posted on any updates as they become available, so stay tuned!\n\n#  When Will The Oxford Casino Reopen 10CRIC?\n\nThe Oxford Casino closed its doors in October 2018, after the state of Maine voted to allow casino gambling. The new law permits any municipality with a population of over 10,000 to have a casino.\n\nThe question on everyone's mind is: when will the Oxford Casino reopen 10CRIC?\n\nThere is no definitive answer at this time, but we can make some educated guesses.\n\nFirst, it is important to note that the Oxford Casino is not the only casino affected by the new law. The Hollywood Casino in Bangor is also impacted. It is likely that both casinos will reopen at some point in 2019.\n\nHowever, it is unclear exactly when that will be. The Hollywood Casino has already announced that it plans to reopen in April 2019. It is possible that the Oxford Casino will follow suit and reopen around the same time.\n\nBut there is also a chance that the Oxford Casino could reopen later in the year. There are still a few regulatory hurdles that need to be cleared before it can reopen 10CRIC. So it's possible that we won't see a reopening until September or October 2019.\n\nIt's exciting times for casino lovers in Maine! We just have to wait and see when the Oxford Casino will reopen 10CRIC. In the meantime, we can enjoy all of the other great things Maine has to offer!\n\n#  Oxford Casino To Reopen 10CRIC \n\nThe Oxford Casino will reopen its doors to the public in just a few short days. The casino has been closed for the past few weeks due to some financial troubles, but things are back on track and the casino will reopen with a brand new name and look.\n\nThe casino is being renamed 10CRIC, which is an abbreviation for \"ten credits\". This new name is meant to signify that the casino is now ready to offer its players top-quality gaming experiences. In addition to the new name, the casino will also be sporting a brand new look, with renovated floors and updated gambling machines.\n\nThe casino has already announced that it will be offering a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and craps. In order to celebrate its reopening, the casino is offering a range of promotions that are sure to please players of all levels.\n\nThere's no doubt that 10CRIC will be one of the hottest casinos in town once it reopens later this week. Be sure to check it out and see what all the fuss is about!\n\n#  10CRIC In Oxford Casino \n\nThe 10CRIC in Oxford Casino is a popular gaming attraction in the city. Visitors can enjoy a range of casino games here, from traditional table games such as roulette and blackjack to modern slots and video poker machines.\n\nThe casino is open every day of the week from 11am until late, so there's plenty of opportunity for gamers to get their fix. In addition to the games floor, there's also a bar and restaurant for visitors to enjoy. The casino is located in the heart of Oxford and is easily accessible from all corners of the city.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun evening out in Oxford, be sure to check out the 10CRIC in Oxford Casino!\n\n#  Oxford Casino Closed For 10CRIC\n\nJust days after making a $10 million investment in the casino,\nSteve Wynn has closed the doors of Oxford Casino for 10 days.\nIn a statement, Wynn Resorts said the closure is due to \"circumstances beyond our control.\"\n\nThe closure comes as a surprise to many, as Oxford Casino was just recently remodeled and given a new name - Twin River Casino.\nIt's unclear what these \"circumstances\" are, but some believe they may have something to do with the recent investigation into Steve Wynn's conduct.\n\nI reached out to Twin River for comment but they declined to respond.\n\nThis is certainly not good news for Oxford Casino employees, who are now left without work during the holiday season.\nHere's hoping Twin River can get things sorted out quickly and resume normal operations soon.","source":"_posts/When-Will-Oxford-Casino-Reopen-10CRIC.md","raw":"---\ntitle: When Will Oxford Casino Reopen 10CRIC\ndate: 2022-10-18 09:42:42\ncategories:\n- Oxford Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n#  When Will Oxford Casino Reopen 10CRIC?\n\nThe Oxford Casino is a popular gambling destination in the United Kingdom.

This is something that is not widely known and it is certainly not common in the sushi industry.\n\nRonin means \"samurai without a master\" in Japanese and the owner decided to name his restaurant after it because he felt like he was starting his own business from scratch. He is originally from Ethiopia himself but he met his wife while they were both living in Japan.\n\nThey have been married for several years now and together they are the proud parents of two young children. His wife is an amazing cook and she has helped him to create some delicious recipes for the menu at Sushi Ronin.\n\nIn fact, many of the dishes on the menu are inspired by her traditional Ethiopian cuisine. Some of the most popular items include the spicy beef yorba, the chickenChangingkarma and the crispy sambusa appetizers.\n\nThe fact that the owner of Sushi Ronin has an Ethiopian wife is certainly something that sets him apart from other sushi chefs in the industry. It is also something that makes his restaurant unique and (hopefully) attractive to customers who are looking for something a little different.\n\n#  Ethiopian wife of sushi ronin owner speaks out!\n\nThe Ethiopian wife of a sushi ronin owner has spoken out about her experiences in the United States.

In this article, we'll be sharing with you some tips and advice on how to quit net casino gambling for good. So, if you're ready to take the plunge, then keep reading!\n\nTip #1: Be Honest With Yourself\n\nThe first step in quitting net casino gambling is being honest with yourself. If you're not honest about your gambling habits, then it's going to be very difficult to overcome them. Therefore, take some time to assess how much money you're spending on gambling and how much time you're spending on it. Once you have an accurate idea of your habits, you can start working on ways to change them.\n\nTip #2: Set Realistic Goals\n\nWhen it comes to quitting net casino gambling, it's important to set realistic goals. Don't try to go from spending hours every day gambling to suddenly never gambling again. That's just not going to happen. Start small by setting a goal to gamble for a certain amount of time each week or only gamble with a certain amount of money. As you get better at staying away from casinos, slowly increase your goals until you no longer feel the urge to gamble.\n\nTip #3: Avoid temptation\n\nOne of the best ways to quit net casino gambling is by avoiding temptation altogether. This means staying away from any and all forms of gambling, including online casinos, lottery tickets, and sports betting. If there's no way for you to physically gamble, then it will be much harder for you to succumb to temptation. Additionally, try distancing yourself from friends or family members who are big gamblers. This will help reduce the chances of relapse.\n\n#  The Truth About How to Stop Playing on the Net Casino \nsites\n\nWe all know how it feels when we get onto our computers, smartphones or\ntablets with the sole intent of taking a break from work or studies, but then an hour later realize we've just spent that time browsing our Facebook newsfeeds or YouTube instead. This is even more likely to happen if you're trying to avoid something else, like work, by playing on casino sites. Obviously, this isn't a desirable outcome, and it would be great if we could find a way to stop it from happening. So, what's the answer? Well, here are some tips on how to stop playing on casino sites so that you can get back to productive activities.\n\n1. Disable notifications\nOne of the main reasons we keep getting drawn back into our casino games is because of the notifications we receive from them. This could be anything from a new high score to seeing that someone has sent us a message. By disabling notifications for these games, we'll be less likely to get drawn back in. On Android devices, you can do this by going into your settings and disabling notifications for the app; for iOS devices, you'll need to go into the game's settings and disable push notifications.\n\n2. Delete the apps/games\nIf disabling notifications doesn't seem to be working for you, then deleting the apps or games themselves may be a better solution. This way, you'll have to go out of your way to reinstall them if you want to play again, and you're less likely to do so impulsively.\n\n3. Have specific times set aside for playing casino games\nIf all else fails, try setting specific times of day where you're allowed to play casino games. This will help to restrict your playtime and make it more intentional. Alternatively, try only playing for certain amounts of time each day – once that time limit is up, stop playing no matter what!\n\n#  How to Effectively Stop Playing on the Net Casino \n\nAlmost everyone has been addicted to playing casino games on the net at some point. The allure of easy money is hard to resist, but eventually, most people come to realize that chasing losses is a waste of time and money. If you're finding it tough to break free from casino gambling, here are some tips that can help:\n\n* Set a strict budget and stick to it.\n\nWhen you're playing online casino games, it's easy to lose track of how much money you're spending. Before you know it, you've blown through your entire bankroll. To avoid this, set a budget for yourself and stick to it. When your funds start running low, quit playing until you can reload.\n\n* Avoid temptation by staying away from casino websites.\n\nIf you're trying to break free from casino gambling, the last thing you want to do is constantly expose yourself to temptation. Avoid visiting casino websites or clicking on any ads promoting gambling sites. Ifnecessary, delete any bookmarks or shortcuts that take you directly to casino websites.\n\n* Find healthier alternatives to satisfy your entertainment needs.\n\nSpending hours in front of a computer screen playing casino games is not good for your mental or physical health. Instead of turning to the internet for entertainment, find healthier alternatives such as reading, going for walks outdoors, or participating in recreational activities with friends and family members.\n\n* Get professional help if necessary.\n\nIf you find it impossible to break free from casino gambling on your own, consider seeking professional help. There are many qualified therapists who can help you overcome an addiction to gambling.\n\n#  How to Get Yourself Out of the Rut of Playing on the Net Casino \n\nThere are times when we all find ourselves stuck in a rut. It might be that job we don't like, or our daily routine that seems to have taken over our life. Whatever it may be, we all need to find ways to break free and get ourselves moving again. For some people, this might mean taking a different route to work or trying a new food they've never had before. For others, it might be something a bit more daring – like sky diving or cliff jumping.\n\nBut for those of us who love gambling, the rut may mean continuing to play on the net casino without any real sense of excitement or motivation. Sure, we may still hit winning streaks every now and then, but for the most part, we're just going through the motions and not really enjoying ourselves. So how do we break out of this rut and get back to enjoying gambling? Here are a few tips:\n\n- Find a new net casino to play at: This is probably the easiest way to get out of a gambling rut. If you're bored with the games and options at your current net casino, head on over to another one and check out what they have to offer. You might find a new game that you love, or even a new betting style that you want to try out.\n\n- Experiment with different bet amounts: Sometimes all it takes is tweaking your bets a bit in order to reignite your excitement for gambling. If you usually stick to the same amount no matter what game you're playing, try spreading your bets out more and see how that impacts your winnings (or losses). You might find that you enjoy gambling more when you're taking more risks!\n\n- Take a break: This is definitely something you should consider if you've been feeling uninterested in gambling lately. There's no shame in stepping away from online casinos for awhile in order to recharge your batteries. In fact, doing so might actually make you appreciate gambling more when you come back to it later on.\n\n#  Tips For Quitting Playing on the Net Casino\n\nNowadays, net casino gaming has turned out to be well-known.

The amount of tax you pay on gambling winnings depends on a number of factors, including your country of residence and whether you are considered a professional or recreational gambler.\n\nFor the majority of people, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. In the US, for example, any gambling winnings over $5,000 are subject to federal income tax. However, there are some exceptions. If you lose money gambling, for example, you can’t claim those losses as a tax deduction.\n\nThe good news is that many countries have partial or full exemptions from gambling taxes for recreational gamblers. For example, in the UK the first £1,000 of gambling winnings each year are tax-free. Australia has a similar exemption of AU$1,500 per year.\n\nIf you’re a professional gambler, things are a little more complicated.

Here are three tips for winning casino money before paying taxes:\n\n1) Claim Gambling Losses on Your Tax Return\n\nWhen you gamble, you can't help but lose sometimes. But don't worry, because you can write those losses off on your tax return.

However, in general, gambling withdrawals are taxable income.\n\nThe first step in determining how much tax is paid on gambling withdrawals is to determine whether the income is considered ordinary or capital.

For example, if you only gamble occasionally and your winnings are relatively small, you may not have to report them to the IRS. However, if you are a regular gambler or if you win a large amount of money, you will likely need to pay taxes on your gambling winnings.\n\nHow do the authorities determine how much tax you owe on your gambling winnings? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the amount of tax you owe will depend on a variety of factors, including your income level and the type of gambling you engage in. Generally speaking, though, gambling income is taxed at ordinary income tax rates.\n\nWhat about losses? Can those be deducted from your taxable gambling income? Again, this depends on the circumstances. If you are able to itemize deductions on your tax return, then you may be able to deduct your losses from your taxable gambling income.

Though it’s important to remember that with gambling, there’s always a chance you could lose money. In the US, gambling winnings are subject to federal income taxes.\n\nThe amount of tax you pay on your gambling winnings depends on how much you win and what type of gambling it is. Here’s a breakdown:\n\nIf you win $1,200 or less in a year from slot machines, bingo, or keno, your winnings are tax-free.\n\nIf you win more than $1,200 but less than $5,000 in a year from slot machines, bingo, or keno, your winnings are subject to a 25% tax.\n\nIf you win more than $5,000 but less than $10,000 in a year from slot machines, bingo, or keno, your winnings are subject to a 30% tax.\n\nIf you win more than $10,000 in a year from any type of gambling, your winnings are subject to a 39.6% tax.\n\nThere are also state taxes that may apply to your gambling winnings. For example, in Nevada and New Jersey , there is no state income tax , so all of your gambling winnings would be taxed at the federal level. In Pennsylvania , state income taxes range from 3.07% to 3.49%, so depending on how much you won, part of your prize could be taxed by the state as well as the feds .\n0\n\n#  How to Calculate Your Taxable Gambling Winnings\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service(I.R.S.) requires taxpayers to report all taxable gambling winnings on their annual tax returns. This article explains the process of how to calculate your taxable gambling winnings and provides helpful examples.\n\n1. Review Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions, for a list of deductible gambling expenses.\n\nDeductible gambling expenses include:\n-Losses from wagering transactions\n-Payments made in connection with playing the Lotteries\n-The cost of purchasing Lottery tickets\n-Amounts paid for food, beverages, or hotel rooms while engaged in gambling activity\n-Transportation costs to and from a gaming establishment\n-Entertainment expenses incurred while at a gaming establishment\n2. Gather documentation of your winnings. This includes records such as:\n-The amount of money or its equivalent won\t-The date of the winning bet or wager\t-The type of bet or wager\t-The name and address of the casino, race track, etc. where the winning occurred\n3. Subtract any losses from your winnings. You may deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings minus any related expenses you may have had (See step 1). Be sure to have written documentation of your losses as well. \n4. Determine if you have to report this income on your tax return. Generally, you must report all taxable gambling winnings on Form 1040, line 21. However, there are exceptions; please consult with a tax professional if needed . \n\n5. Calculate your net gambling income by subtracting allowable deductions from your gross gambling income . Your net gambling income is subject to federal income tax withholding at 24%. This is calculated on Form W2-G .\n\n#  What Are the Federal Taxes on Gambling Winnings?\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the federal agency responsible for collecting taxes on gambling winnings. Gambling income includes, but is not limited to, money or prizes won from casinos, lotteries, horse races and other wagers.\n\nAccording to the IRS, gambling winnings are taxable income and must be reported on your tax return. The amount of tax you owe depends on your total taxable income and filing status.\n\nFor most taxpayers, gambling winnings are considered ordinary income and are taxed at the same rate as other income. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, gambling Winnings that are net of losses are generally not subject to tax. Likewise, certain gambling winnings may be eligible for special tax treatment, such as capital gains or qualified dividends.\n\nIn general, you must report all of your gambling winnings on Form 1040, Line 21. This includes cash winnings and the fair market value of any non-cash prizes you receive. If you itemize deductions on your return, you can also claim any applicable gambling losses on Schedule A, Line 28.\n\nThe following are some basic guidelines for figuring out how much tax you owe on your gambling winnings:\n\n● Winnings from casino games and slot machines are subject to a federal withholding tax of 25%. This means that $25 will be withheld from every $100 you earn in casino winnings. In most cases, this withholding tax is taken out automatically by the casino when you collect your winnings. However, if you receive a large jackpot that is paid out over several years, you may be required to withhold taxes yourself.\n\n● If you have net winnings of $1,200 or more from bingo or slot machines in a year, the IRS requires you to complete Form W-2G and file it with your tax return. This form reports the amount of your winnings and lists the taxes that were withheld from them.\n\n● Winnings from horseracing and other bets are subject to a federal withholding tax of 15%. So if you earn $100 in horseracing bets in a year, $15 will be withheld for federal taxes. Like casino winnings, this withholding tax is usually taken out automatically by the racetrack or other betting institution when you collect your payouts.\n\n● Lottery wins are generally subject to a federal withholding tax of 24%. This means that $24 will be withheld from every $100 in lottery winnings. However, depending on the state where the lottery is based, there may be other state taxes as well. For example, New York state residents must pay an additional 8% state lottery tax on their winnings. So if you won a million dollar lottery prize in New York City, approximately $240K would go towards state and federal taxes ($240K = ($1M * 24%) – ($1M * 8%))).\n\n#  When Do You Have to Report Gambling Winnings?\n\nGambling is a popular form of entertainment, but it’s important to know when you need to report your winnings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The rules for gambling income are different from other types of income, so it’s important to understand what qualifies as gambling income and when it needs to be reported.\n\nGenerally, you have to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, you don’t have to report winnings from bingo, Keno, or slot machines if the winnings are $5,000 or less per year. You also don’t have to report winnings from a raffle or lottery if the value of the prize is $600 or less.\n\nIn addition to reporting your winnings, you also need to report any losses you incurred while gambling. You can deduct these losses from your gambling income, but there are some limitations. For example, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income.\n\nIt’s important to keep records of your gambling activity so that you can accurately report your income and losses on your tax return. This includes receipts for any payments made (including tickets and entry fees), as well as records of any wins and losses.\n\nIf you have questions about how to report your gambling income, please consult a tax professional.\n\n#  What Are the State Taxes on Gambling Winnings?\n\nMost people know that gambling winnings are taxable income, but what are the specific tax rates? And how do they vary based on the state in which you live?\n\nIncome from gambling is taxed at the same rate as other income. The tax rates for 2019 range from 10% to 37%, with most taxpayers falling in the 12% to 25% bracket. However, different states have different rules about how gambling income is taxed.\n\nSome states, like Massachusetts and New York, treat all gambling income as taxable income. Other states, like Nevada and South Dakota, exempt some or all gambling winnings from state income taxes. And still other states, like California and Florida, have a hybrid system that taxes some types of gambling income but not others.\n\nTaxpayers who reside in states with no specific rules about gambling income should use the federal rules as a guide. Gambling income is included in your taxable income, and you must report it on your tax return. The IRS has a detailed publication called “Gambling Income and Expenses” which explains these rules in more detail.\n\nThe bottom line is that gambling income is taxable in every state, but the specific tax rates and rules vary depending on where you live. So if you hit it big at the casino or race track, be sure to check with your state tax department to find out how much of your winnings will be taxed.","source":"_posts/How-Much-Taxes-Do-You-Pay-on-Gambling-Winnings.md","raw":"---\ntitle: How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Gambling Winnings\ndate: 2022-11-15 10:00:14\ncategories:\n- Sports Gambling\ntags:\n- Casino Games\n- Chumba Casino\n- Live Casino\n- Toto Casino\n- Slot Machine\n---\n\n\n#  How Much Taxes Do You Pay on Gambling Winnings?\n\nGambling is a popular way to pass the time and can be very lucrative.

For example, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income.</p>\n<p>It’s important to keep records of your gambling activity so that you can accurately report your income and losses on your tax return. This includes receipts for any payments made (including tickets and entry fees), as well as records of any wins and losses.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about how to report your gambling income, please consult a tax professional.</p>\n<h1 id=\"What-Are-the-State-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings\"><a href=\"#What-Are-the-State-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"What Are the State Taxes on Gambling Winnings?\"></a>What Are the State Taxes on Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>Most people know that gambling winnings are taxable income, but what are the specific tax rates? And how do they vary based on the state in which you live?</p>\n<p>Income from gambling is taxed at the same rate as other income. The tax rates for 2019 range from 10% to 37%, with most taxpayers falling in the 12% to 25% bracket. However, different states have different rules about how gambling income is taxed.</p>\n<p>Some states, like Massachusetts and New York, treat all gambling income as taxable income. Other states, like Nevada and South Dakota, exempt some or all gambling winnings from state income taxes. And still other states, like California and Florida, have a hybrid system that taxes some types of gambling income but not others.</p>\n<p>Taxpayers who reside in states with no specific rules about gambling income should use the federal rules as a guide. Gambling income is included in your taxable income, and you must report it on your tax return. The IRS has a detailed publication called “Gambling Income and Expenses” which explains these rules in more detail.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is that gambling income is taxable in every state, but the specific tax rates and rules vary depending on where you live. So if you hit it big at the casino or race track, be sure to check with your state tax department to find out how much of your winnings will be taxed.</p>\n"},{"title":"Ways for the Gaming Industry to Help Combat Compulsive Gambling","date":"2022-11-15T23:10:57.000Z","_content":"\n\n# Ways for the Gaming Industry to Help Combat Compulsive Gambling \n\nIn order to properly address compulsive gambling, the gaming industry and its stakeholders will need to work together.

It can be caused by different things, such as the type of games played, how often they are played, and how much money is gambled. In this article, we will discuss what gaming addiction is, the signs and symptoms of a gambling addiction, and how businesses in the gaming industry are working to address it.\n\nWhat Is Gaming Addiction?\nGaming addiction is a compulsive disorder that causes someone to become addicted to playing video games or gambling. Gamblers can lose control over their spending and time, often leading to negative consequences in their personal and professional lives. Video game addicts may experience similar problems, including poor academic or job performance, social isolation, and compulsive behaviors related to the game (such as excessive spending on in-game items).\n\nHow Do Different Types of Gaming Cause Addictions?\nThere are three primary types of gaming: social casino games, online slots games, and mobile casino games. Social casino games are those that are played on social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram. They typically involve playing casino-style games against other people online for free or for fake money. Online slots games are those that are played on websites that offer only slot machines. Mobile casino games are played on phones or tablets and usually involve playing casino games against other people online for real money.\n\nAll three types of gaming can lead to gambling addictions, but each one has its own unique risks factors. Social casino games are the most risky because they allow players to spend limitless amounts of money in pursuit of virtual rewards. Online slots games have been shown to be more addictive than other types of online gambling because they have more repetitive gameplay mechanics and offer larger jackpots. Mobile casino games are less risky because players cannot gamble as much money as they want like they can with social casino games and online slots games; however, they can still lead to significant losses if not monitored carefully.\n\nWhat Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Gambling Addiction?\nGambling addicts may exhibit many different signs and symptoms depending on their level of addiction. Generally speaking, though, gambling addicts will display some or all of the following: \n-They will gamble more often than intended or for longer periods than intended \n-They will feel an intense need or urge to gamble \n-They will continue gambling despite negative consequences \n-They will lie about their gambling habits \n-They will steal money or belongings from loved ones in order to gamble  \n-They will neglect personal hygiene or important responsibilities such as work or school \n-They will feel anxious or irritable when unable to gamble\n\n# 5.The Gaming Industry Proven Techniques to Address Compulsive Gambling\n\nIt is no secret that video gaming and gambling have become two of the most popular pastimes in the world. Unlike traditional forms of gambling, however, video gaming allows players to engage in simulated gambling experiences that can be just as addictive and problematic as real-world casino gambling. The lure of winning money or other coveted in-game items has driven many people to excessive and harmful gambling behavior.\n\nThere is now a large and growing body of research on compulsive video gaming and its negative consequences for individuals, families, and society as a whole. This research has identified a number of factors that can contribute to or protect against compulsive video gaming. In this article, we will summarize some of the key findings from current research on compulsive video gaming and suggest ways in which the gaming industry can address this serious public health issue.\n\nFirst, it is important to understand that there is no one cause of compulsive video gaming. Rather, it is likely that a variety of factors interact together to produce this problem. Some of these factors include family history (e.g., genetic vulnerability), personality traits (e.g., impulsivity), environmental influences (e.g., access to games), and psychological problems (e.g., depression).\n\nOne key factor that has been found to increase the risk for developing problems with compulsive video gaming is exposure to gambling advertising and/or gambling content in games. For example, one study found that adolescents who were more likely to develop problems with compulsive video gaming were also more likely to have positive attitudes towards gambling and be exposed to more gambling advertising. This suggests that measures should be taken by the gaming industry to ensure that children and adolescents are not exposed to such content.\n\nIn addition, researchers have identified a number of protective factors that can help prevent or reduce the likelihood of developing problems with compulsive video gaming. These include being aware of the risks associated with excessive gaming, having social support from friends and family members, setting reasonable time limits for playing games, practicing self-control strategies, and receiving treatment for any underlying psychological problems.\n\nNow that we have a better understanding of some of the key risk and protective factors associated with compulsive gaming, let’s take a look at some possible ways in which the gaming industry could address this problem. First, game developers could design games with features that make them less addictive (e.g., reducing opportunities for players to gamble). In addition, game companies could enforce stricter guidelines for marketing their games to children and adolescents. Finally, they could provide resources (e.g., information or treatment) for gamers who may be struggling with excessive play","source":"_posts/Ways-for-the-Gaming-Industry-to-Help-Combat-Compulsive-Gambling-.md","raw":"---\ntitle: Ways for the Gaming Industry to Help Combat Compulsive Gambling \ndate: 2022-11-16 07:10:57\ncategories:\n- Diamond Casino\ntags:\n---\n\n\n# Ways for the Gaming Industry to Help Combat Compulsive Gambling \n\nIn order to properly address compulsive gambling, the gaming industry and its stakeholders will need to work together.

In this article, we will discuss what gaming addiction is, the signs and symptoms of a gambling addiction, and how businesses in the gaming industry are working to address it.</p>\n<p>What Is Gaming Addiction?<br>Gaming addiction is a compulsive disorder that causes someone to become addicted to playing video games or gambling. Gamblers can lose control over their spending and time, often leading to negative consequences in their personal and professional lives. Video game addicts may experience similar problems, including poor academic or job performance, social isolation, and compulsive behaviors related to the game (such as excessive spending on in-game items).</p>\n<p>How Do Different Types of Gaming Cause Addictions?<br>There are three primary types of gaming: social casino games, online slots games, and mobile casino games. Social casino games are those that are played on social media platforms such as Facebook or Instagram. They typically involve playing casino-style games against other people online for free or for fake money. Online slots games are those that are played on websites that offer only slot machines. Mobile casino games are played on phones or tablets and usually involve playing casino games against other people online for real money.</p>\n<p>All three types of gaming can lead to gambling addictions, but each one has its own unique risks factors. Social casino games are the most risky because they allow players to spend limitless amounts of money in pursuit of virtual rewards. Online slots games have been shown to be more addictive than other types of online gambling because they have more repetitive gameplay mechanics and offer larger jackpots. Mobile casino games are less risky because players cannot gamble as much money as they want like they can with social casino games and online slots games; however, they can still lead to significant losses if not monitored carefully.</p>\n<p>What Are the Signs and Symptoms of a Gambling Addiction?<br>Gambling addicts may exhibit many different signs and symptoms depending on their level of addiction. Generally speaking, though, gambling addicts will display some or all of the following:<br>-They will gamble more often than intended or for longer periods than intended<br>-They will feel an intense need or urge to gamble<br>-They will continue gambling despite negative consequences<br>-They will lie about their gambling habits<br>-They will steal money or belongings from loved ones in order to gamble<br>-They will neglect personal hygiene or important responsibilities such as work or school<br>-They will feel anxious or irritable when unable to gamble</p>\n<h1 id=\"5-The-Gaming-Industry-Proven-Techniques-to-Address-Compulsive-Gambling\"><a href=\"#5-The-Gaming-Industry-Proven-Techniques-to-Address-Compulsive-Gambling\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"5.The Gaming Industry Proven Techniques to Address Compulsive Gambling\"></a>5.The Gaming Industry Proven Techniques to Address Compulsive Gambling</h1><p>It is no secret that video gaming and gambling have become two of the most popular pastimes in the world. Unlike traditional forms of gambling, however, video gaming allows players to engage in simulated gambling experiences that can be just as addictive and problematic as real-world casino gambling. The lure of winning money or other coveted in-game items has driven many people to excessive and harmful gambling behavior.</p>\n<p>There is now a large and growing body of research on compulsive video gaming and its negative consequences for individuals, families, and society as a whole. This research has identified a number of factors that can contribute to or protect against compulsive video gaming. In this article, we will summarize some of the key findings from current research on compulsive video gaming and suggest ways in which the gaming industry can address this serious public health issue.</p>\n<p>First, it is important to understand that there is no one cause of compulsive video gaming. Rather, it is likely that a variety of factors interact together to produce this problem. Some of these factors include family history (e.g., genetic vulnerability), personality traits (e.g., impulsivity), environmental influences (e.g., access to games), and psychological problems (e.g., depression).</p>\n<p>One key factor that has been found to increase the risk for developing problems with compulsive video gaming is exposure to gambling advertising and/or gambling content in games. For example, one study found that adolescents who were more likely to develop problems with compulsive video gaming were also more likely to have positive attitudes towards gambling and be exposed to more gambling advertising. This suggests that measures should be taken by the gaming industry to ensure that children and adolescents are not exposed to such content.</p>\n<p>In addition, researchers have identified a number of protective factors that can help prevent or reduce the likelihood of developing problems with compulsive video gaming. These include being aware of the risks associated with excessive gaming, having social support from friends and family members, setting reasonable time limits for playing games, practicing self-control strategies, and receiving treatment for any underlying psychological problems.</p>\n<p>Now that we have a better understanding of some of the key risk and protective factors associated with compulsive gaming, let’s take a look at some possible ways in which the gaming industry could address this problem. First, game developers could design games with features that make them less addictive (e.g., reducing opportunities for players to gamble). In addition, game companies could enforce stricter guidelines for marketing their games to children and adolescents. Finally, they could provide resources (e.g., information or treatment) for gamers who may be struggling with excessive play</p>\n"}],"PostAsset":[],"PostCategory":[{"post_id":"cl6ni18pi0001kwv57terfhhl","category_id":"cl6ni18po0003kwv5h4ocgn57","_id":"cl6ni18pt0006kwv5glspc41b"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","category_id":"cl6ni18po0003kwv5h4ocgn57","_id":"cl85rye9w000258v50jhf5mmd"},{"post_id":"cl8cxt2ec0000b0v56ws6b5am","category_id":"cl8cxt2em0001b0v5cywifya0","_id":"cl8cxt2eq0002b0v56doz6t3o"},{"post_id":"cl8e5j3xw0000e0v53m2ldzta","category_id":"cl8cxt2em0001b0v5cywifya0","_id":"cl8e5j3y40001e0v52je724ce"},{"post_id":"cl8il98720000swv50oh21jo7","category_id":"cl8cxt2em0001b0v5cywifya0","_id":"cl8il987b0001swv57jxh9u8l"},{"post_id":"cl8l1bi550000kgv596cfhvnh","category_id":"cl8cxt2em0001b0v5cywifya0","_id":"cl8l1bi5k0001kgv5f58j9tho"},{"post_id":"cl8uy0ju4000080v56uu9a52i","category_id":"cl8uy0juh000180v58w5i3vu9","_id":"cl8uy0jum000280v58bqn7tbb"},{"post_id":"cl8wgbr1h0000igv5da6b9sav","category_id":"cl8uy0juh000180v58w5i3vu9","_id":"cl8wgbr1w0002igv549ope8ul"},{"post_id":"cl9255f6f0000rkv50oacfnme","category_id":"cl9255f6z0001rkv5ac0r1xad","_id":"cl9255f750002rkv50a2v1cho"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","category_id":"cl9c4o7tj0001fgv5b5809zc0","_id":"cl9c4o7tr0004fgv5e5a83nmf"},{"post_id":"cl9djjdxt0000uwv5arw52ai9","category_id":"cl9djjdxz0001uwv5ev6k543c","_id":"cl9djjdy30002uwv52ahx3g0j"},{"post_id":"cl9retj6r0000bcv50ok01g5d","category_id":"cl9retj6x0001bcv56zkdaf1b","_id":"cl9retj720002bcv5fzas9ndl"},{"post_id":"cl9sox02b00005wv53xs08k25","category_id":"cl9retj6x0001bcv56zkdaf1b","_id":"cl9sox02i00015wv56rpw080g"},{"post_id":"cl9xkqdpg00004kv517qa39bh","category_id":"cl9djjdxz0001uwv5ev6k543c","_id":"cl9xkqdpl00014kv5djqz2n2h"},{"post_id":"cl9ylucq30000z0v51vsjck5h","category_id":"cl9retj6x0001bcv56zkdaf1b","_id":"cl9ylucqb0001z0v506xp71yd"},{"post_id":"cl9zseq4j0000wgv51bde3ys1","category_id":"cl9djjdxz0001uwv5ev6k543c","_id":"cl9zseq4p0001wgv5d4kj0y9c"},{"post_id":"cla7nj0ue0000lsv5207s7qtt","category_id":"cla7nj0uj0001lsv5586f1j9j","_id":"cla7nj0uq0004lsv5blltf95q"},{"post_id":"cla8pfopk0000acv5g6ur5ky3","category_id":"cl9c4o7tj0001fgv5b5809zc0","_id":"cla8pfopp0001acv5ayw719bl"},{"post_id":"cla9tp59000002gv504f5duyv","category_id":"cl9djjdxz0001uwv5ev6k543c","_id":"cla9tp59600012gv5e6zlaiub"},{"post_id":"clac26yu70000akv5bnf602p9","category_id":"cl9djjdxz0001uwv5ev6k543c","_id":"clac26yuf0001akv5d532bfxd"},{"post_id":"clahkhs1z0000vwv5e6x0fbc4","category_id":"clahkhs280001vwv52vns1s45","_id":"clahkhs2g0004vwv5av6af25f"},{"post_id":"claitvxgb0000dwv5892gag9m","category_id":"claitvxgg0001dwv5dwmvhpcw","_id":"claitvxgm0002dwv55xg65j6l"}],"PostTag":[{"post_id":"cl6ni18pi0001kwv57terfhhl","tag_id":"cl6ni18pq0004kwv52mx360tc","_id":"cl6ni18px000akwv5eukf12pj"},{"post_id":"cl6ni18pi0001kwv57terfhhl","tag_id":"cl6ni18ps0005kwv53naj31s9","_id":"cl6ni18px000bkwv543vhd7dk"},{"post_id":"cl6ni18pi0001kwv57terfhhl","tag_id":"cl6ni18pu0007kwv52sam8y5t","_id":"cl6ni18py000ckwv5ee0vdnbv"},{"post_id":"cl6ni18pi0001kwv57terfhhl","tag_id":"cl6ni18pv0008kwv5cbbh2vbq","_id":"cl6ni18py000dkwv5a7yg6vm1"},{"post_id":"cl6ni18pi0001kwv57terfhhl","tag_id":"cl6ni18pw0009kwv59z3c64rx","_id":"cl6ni18py000ekwv54nqn756i"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","tag_id":"cl85rye9u000158v544dd1bvu","_id":"cl85ryea0000858v58het7mzs"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","tag_id":"cl85rye9x000358v52xvl8ci5","_id":"cl85ryea0000958v5eybp4evo"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","tag_id":"cl85rye9x000458v5hxjlh6zg","_id":"cl85ryea0000a58v5f8gpgztg"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","tag_id":"cl85rye9y000558v5atu45x0m","_id":"cl85ryea0000b58v5adct276b"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","tag_id":"cl85rye9y000658v5hlsz5dp5","_id":"cl85ryea0000c58v5bh061w2c"},{"post_id":"cl85rye9m000058v530cghjhg","tag_id":"cl85rye9z000758v5ggyd22ry","_id":"cl85ryea0000d58v55lca68v0"},{"post_id":"cl8wgbr1h0000igv5da6b9sav","tag_id":"cl8wgbr1s0001igv5dztue7x5","_id":"cl8wgbr1z0005igv5bf7445dj"},{"post_id":"cl8wgbr1h0000igv5da6b9sav","tag_id":"cl8wgbr1x0003igv52g6k1me9","_id":"cl8wgbr1z0006igv5cjuv3d99"},{"post_id":"cl8wgbr1h0000igv5da6b9sav","tag_id":"cl8wgbr1y0004igv544af925v","_id":"cl8wgbr1z0007igv564qihp5f"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tp0002fgv515759alk","_id":"cl9c4o7tw000bfgv5ahiyck69"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tq0003fgv5cy5x6e3m","_id":"cl9c4o7tw000cfgv5fz3e8pxm"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tr0005fgv590ij9kft","_id":"cl9c4o7tx000dfgv5fd367jwu"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7ts0006fgv5969lamg8","_id":"cl9c4o7tx000efgv5dkioe6fi"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tt0007fgv522h28uvd","_id":"cl9c4o7tx000ffgv59628gw5g"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tt0008fgv55a3149zn","_id":"cl9c4o7tx000gfgv551je6ze4"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tu0009fgv57mjy6k8a","_id":"cl9c4o7tx000hfgv5ep9lazx4"},{"post_id":"cl9c4o7td0000fgv5ha641qnd","tag_id":"cl9c4o7tv00
