<p>The study, conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the American Gaming Association, looked at the tax rates for different types of gambling winnings. It found that the majority of gamblers – 87 percent – can keep between 36 and 44 percent of their winnings before paying taxes.</p>
<p>The findings are good news for gamblers, as they suggest that they can keep a larger portion of their winnings than previously thought. However, the study also shows that there is a lot of variability in tax rates, so it’s important to consult with a tax professional to figure out your specific situation.</p>
<p>The study also found that casino gambling is the most heavily taxed form of gambling, with players able to keep only 24 percent of their winnings on average. Lottery players fare slightly better, keeping 31 percent of their winnings on average. And while players of racetracks and tribal casinos can keep 38 percent and 49 percent of their winnings, respectively, those numbers are still lower than what players can keep from online poker and blackjack games (51 percent).</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to make some extra money gambling this year, it’s important to research the tax implications of your chosen game. But overall, the study shows that winners can keep a good chunk of their earnings!</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Tax-Do-You-Pay-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-Much-Tax-Do-You-Pay-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Much Tax Do You Pay on Gambling Winnings?"></a>How Much Tax Do You Pay on Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>A number of different taxes may be levied on gambling winnings, depending on the jurisdiction. Income tax, excise tax, and custom duties may all apply.</p>
<p>Income tax is the most common type of tax to be levied on gambling winnings. The income tax rate will vary depending on the individual’s income and residency status. For example, in the United States, gambling winnings are subject to federal income tax rates of up to 39.6%, depending on the individual’s taxable income.</p>
<p>Excise tax is another common type of tax to be levied on gambling winnings. This type of tax is generally imposed by states or local governments and applies to all types of gambling, not just lotteries or casinos. The rate of excise tax usually depends on the amount of money won.</p>
<p>Custom duties may also be charged on gambling winnings that are brought into a country from abroad. These duties are generally charged in addition to income tax or excise tax, and can range from 0% to 50% or more of the value of the winning bets.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Clarifies-Tax-Rules-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#IRS-Clarifies-Tax-Rules-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS Clarifies Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings"></a>IRS Clarifies Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings</h1><p>In a recent statement, the IRS clarified the tax rules for gambling winnings. According to the statement, individuals who win gambling prizes must report the winnings as taxable income.</p>
<p>The statement covers all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. In addition, it applies to both professional and amateur gamblers.</p>
<p>As with any other form of income, gambling winnings must be reported on a person’s tax return. The amount of tax owed will depend on the individual’s tax bracket.</p>
<p>Individuals who lose money gambling can usually deduct their losses from their taxable income. However, note that these losses can only be deducted up to the amount of gambling income that was reported on the return. In other words, you can’t use your losses to reduce your taxes beyond what you actually won.</p>
<p>The IRS also clarified rules for paying taxes on gambling winnings. In most cases, taxes must be paid in full as soon as possible. However, there are a few exceptions: </p>
<ul>
<li>If a taxpayer wins over $5,000 in one day and the prize is not paid in full immediately, they may be required to report the winnings annually rather than in one lump sum. </li>
<li>Winnings from bingo or keno played in Illinois may be exempt from state taxes if they are less than $1,200 per calendar year. </li>
<li>Gambling losses cannot be used to offset non-gambling income. </li>
</ul>
<p>The full statement from the IRS can be found on their website: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-clarifies-tax-rules-for-gambling-winnings">https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-clarifies-tax-rules-for-gambling-winnings</a></p>
<h1 id="You-May-Owe-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings-Even-If-You-Lose"><a href="#You-May-Owe-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings-Even-If-You-Lose" class="headerlink" title="You May Owe Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings, Even If You Lose"></a>You May Owe Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings, Even If You Lose</h1><p>Gambling may be a fun pastime, but it can also lead to some surprise tax bills. In most cases, you have to pay taxes on your gambling winnings, even if you lose money in the process.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you gamble at a charity event or in a state that doesn’t tax gambling income, you won’t have to pay taxes on your winnings. However, in most cases, you’ll need to report any gambling income on your tax return.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling losses can also be deductible. So if you lose money while gambling, you can deduct those losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>To claim your gambling losses, you’ll need to keep track of all of your bets and winnings. You should also keep track of any expenses related to gambling, such as travel costs and hotel bills.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income and losses, talk to a tax professional. They can help make sure that you’re reporting everything correctly and that you’re taking advantage of all the deductions available to you.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Pay-Your-Fair-Share-of-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Pay-Your-Fair-Share-of-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Pay Your Fair Share of Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings"></a>Get Ready to Pay Your Fair Share of Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The odds are in your favor when you gamble, but don’t forget that you may have to pay taxes on your winnings. The good news is that gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income, so make sure to keep good records.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is determine if your gambling income is taxable. Gambling income includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>*Winning at casino games<br>*Prizes from lotteries and raffles<br>*Poker and other card games<br>*Sports betting<br>*Any other wagers or bets</p>
<p>Even if your gambling income is not subject to taxation, you may still be required to report it on your tax return. This is especially true if you receive gambling winnings in excess of $5,000 during the year. In cases like this, the IRS will require you to complete Form W-2G, which will report the amount of your winnings and any applicable withholding taxes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income, be sure to consult with a tax professional.</p>
