	  <h1 id="What-is-Kings-Crown"><a href="#What-is-Kings-Crown" class="headerlink" title="What is Kings Crown?"></a>What is Kings Crown?</h1><p>Kings Crown is a new cryptocurrency that has been making waves in the crypto community. It is built on the Ethereum network and uses the ERC-20 token standard. Kings Crown was created by a team of developers who are passionate about blockchain technology and its potential to change the world.</p>
<p>The Kings Crown team is committed to building a strong community around the coin and providing users with a great experience. They have already released a desktop wallet for Windows, Mac, and Linux, and a mobile wallet for Android and iOS. They are also working on a pools, exchanges, and merchant services.</p>
<p>One of the things that makes Kings Crown unique is its focus on privacy and security. The coin uses Tor anonymity networks and elliptical curve cryptography to protect user identities and transactions. This makes Kings Crown ideal for use in black markets and other areas where privacy is essential.</p>
<p>Another key difference between Kings Crown and other cryptocurrencies is its governance model. Unlike Bitcoin, which is controlled by miners, Kings Crown is controlled by its users. This means that anyone can propose changes to the coin and vote on them using the tokens they own. This ensures that the community has a say in how the coin develops into the future.</p>
<p>Kings Crown is still in its early days, but it has already shown promise as a leading cryptocurrency. If you want to get involved in this exciting new project, you can buy tokens at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.kingscrowncoin.com/">www.kingscrowncoin.com</a></p>
