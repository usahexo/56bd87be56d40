<p>The study, conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas and the American Gaming Association, looked at the tax rates for different types of gambling winnings. It found that the majority of gamblers – 87 percent – can keep between 36 and 44 percent of their winnings before paying taxes.</p>
<p>The findings are good news for gamblers, as they suggest that they can keep a larger portion of their winnings than previously thought. However, the study also shows that there is a lot of variability in tax rates, so it’s important to consult with a tax professional to figure out your specific situation.</p>
<p>The study also found that casino gambling is the most heavily taxed form of gambling, with players able to keep only 24 percent of their winnings on average. Lottery players fare slightly better, keeping 31 percent of their winnings on average. And while players of racetracks and tribal casinos can keep 38 percent and 49 percent of their winnings, respectively, those numbers are still lower than what players can keep from online poker and blackjack games (51 percent).</p>
<p>So if you’re looking to make some extra money gambling this year, it’s important to research the tax implications of your chosen game. But overall, the study shows that winners can keep a good chunk of their earnings!</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Tax-Do-You-Pay-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-Much-Tax-Do-You-Pay-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How Much Tax Do You Pay on Gambling Winnings?"></a>How Much Tax Do You Pay on Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>A number of different taxes may be levied on gambling winnings, depending on the jurisdiction. Income tax, excise tax, and custom duties may all apply.</p>
<p>Income tax is the most common type of tax to be levied on gambling winnings. The income tax rate will vary depending on the individual’s income and residency status. For example, in the United States, gambling winnings are subject to federal income tax rates of up to 39.6%, depending on the individual’s taxable income.</p>
<p>Excise tax is another common type of tax to be levied on gambling winnings. This type of tax is generally imposed by states or local governments and applies to all types of gambling, not just lotteries or casinos. The rate of excise tax usually depends on the amount of money won.</p>
<p>Custom duties may also be charged on gambling winnings that are brought into a country from abroad. These duties are generally charged in addition to income tax or excise tax, and can range from 0% to 50% or more of the value of the winning bets.</p>
<h1 id="IRS-Clarifies-Tax-Rules-for-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#IRS-Clarifies-Tax-Rules-for-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="IRS Clarifies Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings"></a>IRS Clarifies Tax Rules for Gambling Winnings</h1><p>In a recent statement, the IRS clarified the tax rules for gambling winnings. According to the statement, individuals who win gambling prizes must report the winnings as taxable income.</p>
<p>The statement covers all forms of gambling, including casino games, lotteries, and sports betting. In addition, it applies to both professional and amateur gamblers.</p>
<p>As with any other form of income, gambling winnings must be reported on a person’s tax return. The amount of tax owed will depend on the individual’s tax bracket.</p>
<p>Individuals who lose money gambling can usually deduct their losses from their taxable income. However, note that these losses can only be deducted up to the amount of gambling income that was reported on the return. In other words, you can’t use your losses to reduce your taxes beyond what you actually won.</p>
<p>The IRS also clarified rules for paying taxes on gambling winnings. In most cases, taxes must be paid in full as soon as possible. However, there are a few exceptions: </p>
<ul>
<li>If a taxpayer wins over $5,000 in one day and the prize is not paid in full immediately, they may be required to report the winnings annually rather than in one lump sum. </li>
<li>Winnings from bingo or keno played in Illinois may be exempt from state taxes if they are less than $1,200 per calendar year. </li>
<li>Gambling losses cannot be used to offset non-gambling income. </li>
</ul>
<p>The full statement from the IRS can be found on their website: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-clarifies-tax-rules-for-gambling-winnings">https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-clarifies-tax-rules-for-gambling-winnings</a></p>
<h1 id="You-May-Owe-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings-Even-If-You-Lose"><a href="#You-May-Owe-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings-Even-If-You-Lose" class="headerlink" title="You May Owe Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings, Even If You Lose"></a>You May Owe Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings, Even If You Lose</h1><p>Gambling may be a fun pastime, but it can also lead to some surprise tax bills. In most cases, you have to pay taxes on your gambling winnings, even if you lose money in the process.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. If you gamble at a charity event or in a state that doesn’t tax gambling income, you won’t have to pay taxes on your winnings. However, in most cases, you’ll need to report any gambling income on your tax return.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling losses can also be deductible. So if you lose money while gambling, you can deduct those losses from your taxable income.</p>
<p>To claim your gambling losses, you’ll need to keep track of all of your bets and winnings. You should also keep track of any expenses related to gambling, such as travel costs and hotel bills.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income and losses, talk to a tax professional. They can help make sure that you’re reporting everything correctly and that you’re taking advantage of all the deductions available to you.</p>
<h1 id="Get-Ready-to-Pay-Your-Fair-Share-of-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Get-Ready-to-Pay-Your-Fair-Share-of-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Get Ready to Pay Your Fair Share of Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings"></a>Get Ready to Pay Your Fair Share of Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The odds are in your favor when you gamble, but don’t forget that you may have to pay taxes on your winnings. The good news is that gambling losses can be used to offset gambling income, so make sure to keep good records.</p>
<p>The first thing you need to do is determine if your gambling income is taxable. Gambling income includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p>
<p>*Winning at casino games<br>*Prizes from lotteries and raffles<br>*Poker and other card games<br>*Sports betting<br>*Any other wagers or bets</p>
<p>Even if your gambling income is not subject to taxation, you may still be required to report it on your tax return. This is especially true if you receive gambling winnings in excess of $5,000 during the year. In cases like this, the IRS will require you to complete Form W-2G, which will report the amount of your winnings and any applicable withholding taxes.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about how to report your gambling income, be sure to consult with a tax professional.</p>

Gambling income includes winnings from lotteries, raffles, horse races, and casino games. If you’re lucky enough to win a big jackpot or hit a lucky streak while gambling, don’t forget that you may need to report those earnings on your tax return.</p>
<p>The good news is that gambling losses can be deducted from your gambling income. So, if you have $10,000 in gambling income but also have $5,000 in gambling losses, you would only have to pay taxes on $5,000 of your earnings.</p>
<p>However, there are some important things to keep in mind when it comes to reporting gambling income. For starters, you’ll need to keep track of all of your winnings and losses throughout the year. This information should be reported on Schedule C (Profit or Loss from Business) or Schedule A (Itemized Deductions) of your tax return.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can only deduct your losses up to the amount of your total gambling income. So if you have $10,000 in gambling income and $8,000 in losses, you can only deduct $2,000 worth of losses on your tax return.</p>
<p>And finally, most types of gambling winnings are subject to federal taxes. However, there are a few exceptions such as winnings from state-sponsored lotteries and sweepstakes.</p>
<p>So if you’re lucky enough to hit it big while gambling this year, don’t forget to report those earnings on your tax return. Just be sure to keep track of your winnings and losses throughout the year so that everything is correctly reported come tax time.</p>
<h1 id="How-Much-Can-You-Win-From-Gambling-Before-Paying-Taxes"><a href="#How-Much-Can-You-Win-From-Gambling-Before-Paying-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="How Much Can You Win From Gambling Before Paying Taxes?"></a>How Much Can You Win From Gambling Before Paying Taxes?</h1><p>Gambling is often seen as a way to make easy money, but how much can you really win before you have to start paying taxes? This guide will break down the gambling taxes you may need to pay depending on your winning amount.</p>
<p>As with most things tax related, the answer is not straightforward. The amount of tax you pay on gambling winnings depends on a number of factors, including your country of residence and whether you are considered a professional or recreational gambler.</p>
<p>For the majority of people, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. In the US, for example, any gambling winnings over $5,000 are subject to federal income tax. However, there are some exceptions. If you lose money gambling, for example, you can’t claim those losses as a tax deduction.</p>
<p>The good news is that many countries have partial or full exemptions from gambling taxes for recreational gamblers. For example, in the UK the first £1,000 of gambling winnings each year are tax-free. Australia has a similar exemption of AU$1,500 per year.</p>
<p>If you’re a professional gambler, things are a little more complicated. In most cases, your gambling income is considered business income and is subject to income tax. You may also be liable for social security and other taxes depending on your country of residence.</p>
<p>So how much can you really win before having to start paying taxes? The answer depends on where you live and how you gamble. But in most cases, if you keep your winnings below $5,000 (or the equivalent in your local currency), you won’t have to worry about paying any taxes on them.</p>
<h1 id="Winning-Casino-Money-Before-Paying-Taxes"><a href="#Winning-Casino-Money-Before-Paying-Taxes" class="headerlink" title="Winning Casino Money Before Paying Taxes"></a>Winning Casino Money Before Paying Taxes</h1><p>In the United States, casino taxes are generally considered to be a part of one’s income tax obligation. This means that if someone hits it big at a casino and walks away with $50,000 in winnings, they will owe federal and state income taxes on that amount.</p>
<p>However, there are ways to legally reduce or even eliminate one’s casino tax obligations. Here are three tips for winning casino money before paying taxes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Claim Gambling Losses on Your Tax Return</li>
</ol>
<p>When you gamble, you can’t help but lose sometimes. But don’t worry, because you can write those losses off on your tax return. This will reduce your taxable income, and as a result, your total tax bill.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Use a Tax-Deferred Account to Store Your Winnings</li>
</ol>
<p>If you hit it big at the casino and want to avoid paying taxes on your winnings right away, consider using a tax-deferred account like a 401(k) or IRA. These accounts allow you to postpone paying taxes on your earnings until you retire or withdraw the money.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Invest Your Winnings in a Tax-Free Vehicle Like Municipal Bonds</li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t want to use a tax-deferred account to store your winnings, another option is to invest them in a tax-free vehicle like municipal bonds. This way, you won’t have to pay any taxes on your earnings for the duration of the investment.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Withdrawals-How-Much-Tax-is-Paid"><a href="#Gambling-Withdrawals-How-Much-Tax-is-Paid" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Withdrawals: How Much Tax is Paid?"></a>Gambling Withdrawals: How Much Tax is Paid?</h1><p>When a person withdraws money from their gambling account, how much tax do they have to pay on that withdrawal? This question is not as easy to answer as one might think, because it depends on a variety of factors including the amount of the withdrawal and the individual’s tax situation. However, in general, gambling withdrawals are taxable income.</p>
<p>The first step in determining how much tax is paid on gambling withdrawals is to determine whether the income is considered ordinary or capital. Ordinary income is taxable as regular income, while capital gains are taxed at a lower rate. Gambling income is typically considered ordinary income, because it is usually seen as being analogous to regular salary or wages. This means that gambling withdrawals are typically taxable as regular income.</p>
<p>However, there are some exceptions. For example, if the individual can prove that their gambling activity was for entertainment purposes only and not for profit, then the gambling income may be considered capital gain instead of ordinary income. In this case, the tax rate on capital gains would apply rather than the standard tax rate for regular income.</p>
<p>Another exception applies to winnings from lotteries or raffles. These types of winnings are considered capital gains rather than ordinary income, regardless of whether the individual was using the proceeds for personal or business purposes. This is because lotteries and raffles are considered games of chance, and any profits from such games are taxed at the lower capital gains rate.</p>
<p>In general, then, most gambling withdrawals are taxable as ordinary income. However, there may be some instances where the gambling income can be taxed at the lower capital gains rate. It is important to speak with an accountant or tax specialist to determine how much tax is owed on gambling withdrawals in a particular case.</p>
<h1 id="Can-You-Get-Away-With-Not-Paying-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#Can-You-Get-Away-With-Not-Paying-Taxes-on-Your-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Can You Get Away With Not Paying Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings?"></a>Can You Get Away With Not Paying Taxes on Your Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>A lot of people like to gamble. Whether it be casino games, betting on sports or playing the lottery, for some people, gambling can be a fun and exciting way to pass the time. But what happens when you win? Is all of that money taxable?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is not always straightforward. For example, if you only gamble occasionally and your winnings are relatively small, you may not have to report them to the IRS. However, if you are a regular gambler or if you win a large amount of money, you will likely need to pay taxes on your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>How do the authorities determine how much tax you owe on your gambling winnings? There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the amount of tax you owe will depend on a variety of factors, including your income level and the type of gambling you engage in. Generally speaking, though, gambling income is taxed at ordinary income tax rates.</p>
<p>What about losses? Can those be deducted from your taxable gambling income? Again, this depends on the circumstances. If you are able to itemize deductions on your tax return, then you may be able to deduct your losses from your taxable gambling income. However, if you take the standard deduction instead of itemizing deductions, then you cannot deduct your gambling losses.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that not all gambling activities are treated equally by the IRS. For example, betting on horse races is considered more heavily taxed than other types of gambling activities. This is because horse racing is considered a “professional” activity, while other types of gambling are considered “hobby” activities.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about whether or not you need to pay taxes on your gambling winnings, it is best to consult with a qualified tax professional.</p>

		<h1 id="Sushi-Ronin-owner-has-Ethiopian-wife"><a href="#Sushi-Ronin-owner-has-Ethiopian-wife" class="headerlink" title="Sushi Ronin owner has Ethiopian wife!"></a>Sushi Ronin owner has Ethiopian wife!</h1><p>The owner of Sushi Ronin, a popular sushi restaurant in Brooklyn, New York, has an Ethiopian wife. This is something that is not widely known and it is certainly not common in the sushi industry.</p>
<p>Ronin means “samurai without a master” in Japanese and the owner decided to name his restaurant after it because he felt like he was starting his own business from scratch. He is originally from Ethiopia himself but he met his wife while they were both living in Japan.</p>
<p>They have been married for several years now and together they are the proud parents of two young children. His wife is an amazing cook and she has helped him to create some delicious recipes for the menu at Sushi Ronin.</p>
<p>In fact, many of the dishes on the menu are inspired by her traditional Ethiopian cuisine. Some of the most popular items include the spicy beef yorba, the chickenChangingkarma and the crispy sambusa appetizers.</p>
<p>The fact that the owner of Sushi Ronin has an Ethiopian wife is certainly something that sets him apart from other sushi chefs in the industry. It is also something that makes his restaurant unique and (hopefully) attractive to customers who are looking for something a little different.</p>
<h1 id="Ethiopian-wife-of-sushi-ronin-owner-speaks-out"><a href="#Ethiopian-wife-of-sushi-ronin-owner-speaks-out" class="headerlink" title="Ethiopian wife of sushi ronin owner speaks out!"></a>Ethiopian wife of sushi ronin owner speaks out!</h1><p>The Ethiopian wife of a sushi ronin owner has spoken out about her experiences in the United States. She has faced discrimination and bigotry ever since she arrived, but she has persevered and is now thriving in her new home.</p>
<p>“I have experienced a lot of racism since I moved to the US,” she said in an interview. “People have called me all sorts of names and have made fun of my accent. But I’ve refused to let them get to me. I am proud of who I am, and I know that I am just as good as anyone else.”</p>
<p>She went on to say that she was grateful for the opportunities that America had given her. “Despite all the hate and discrimination, America is still a great country. There are so many opportunities here, and I am grateful for every one of them.”</p>
<p>She also spoke about how her husband had supported her throughout it all. “My husband has been my rock throughout all of this. He has always been there for me, and he has never given up on me. I am so lucky to have him by my side.”</p>
<p>The Ethiopian wife of a sushi ronin owner is a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit. Despite facing bigotry and discrimination, she has persevered and is now thriving in her new home. We should all be inspired by her story, and we should work to create a society that is inclusive and welcoming for everyone.</p>

When questioned why he would choose someone from such a different culture, the owner defended his actions, stating that he fell in love with her and that she was the perfect woman for him.</p>
<p>Many people have criticized the owner, saying that it is wrong to marry someone from a different culture, but he stands by his decision. He believes that everyone is entitled to love whoever they want, and he is happy to be married to the woman he loves.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-you-think-about-sushi-ronin-owner’s-ethopian-wife"><a href="#What-do-you-think-about-sushi-ronin-owner’s-ethopian-wife" class="headerlink" title="What do you think about sushi ronin owner’s ethopian wife?"></a>What do you think about sushi ronin owner’s ethopian wife?</h1><p>I think the sushi ronin owner’s ethopian wife is a really good addition to the business. She’s helping to serve up some amazing ethiopian food, and she seems to really enjoy it. I think it’s great that she’s part of the business, and I’m excited to see what she comes up with next.</p>
<h1 id="Owner-of-sushi-ronin-defends-restaurant-after-receiving-criticism-for-marrying-ethopian-woman"><a href="#Owner-of-sushi-ronin-defends-restaurant-after-receiving-criticism-for-marrying-ethopian-woman" class="headerlink" title="Owner of sushi ronin defends restaurant after receiving criticism for marrying ethopian woman"></a>Owner of sushi ronin defends restaurant after receiving criticism for marrying ethopian woman</h1><p>I am the owner of sushi ronin, and I am writing in response to the hateful and ignorant comments that have been left on our yelp page. Our restaurant is a place where people of all cultures and backgrounds are welcome, and we proudly serve ethopian cuisine.</p>
<p>Our waitress, melia, is a wonderful woman who has always treated our customers with kindness and respect. She is beloved by all who know her, including me. I am proud to be married to her, and nothing you say will ever change that.</p>
<p>Sushi ronin is a place for open-minded people who appreciate different cultures and cuisines. If you don’t like it, then please feel free to leave. We don’t need your hate or bigotry.</p>

You will need a few supplies though, including a diamond miner pickaxe, a roulette table, and some potatoes.</p>
<p>To begin, you will need to find a suitable location for your roulette table. It is best to find an open area with plenty of flat surface to work with. For the best results, place the table in an area with few obstructions and plenty of light. Once you have found the perfect spot, it is time to set up the table.</p>
<p>The first step is to place the green cloth on top of the table. This will serve as your playing surface. Next, set the ball on top of the cloth and place the betting circles around it. Finally, set the chips on their assigned betting locations.</p>
<p>Now that the table is set up, it is time to start collecting chips! To do this, simply use your diamond pickaxe to mine through the wall directly in front of the roulette table. Be sure to aim carefully, as you only have one shot at each chip. If you miss, you will need to reset the Roulette table and try again.</p>
<p>Once you have collected all of the chips in front of the table, it is time for another round! Just be sure to watch out for obstacles this time, as they can block your shots and make it difficult to collect all of the chips.</p>

However, it was forced to close its doors in January 2019 due to financial difficulties. Many people are wondering when it will reopen and how they can participate in the reopening festivities. In this article, we will explore the possible reopening dates for the Oxford Casino and provide information on how you can get involved.</p>
<p>According to an article from The Guardian, the Oxford Casino hopes to reopen by summer 2019. However, there has been no official confirmation of this date. In order to participate in the reopening festivities, you will need to keep an eye on the casino’s website and social media pages. The casino plans to release more information in the coming weeks and months.</p>
<p>In addition, the casino is offering a number of promotions in anticipation of its reopening. These promotions include a “reopening bonus” that will be available to new and existing customers. Details on this bonus have not been released yet, but we can expect more information in the near future. The casino is also giving away free spins and other prizes leading up to its reopening. So be sure to watch out for these promotions!</p>
<p>So what can you expect from the Oxford Casino when it reopens? Well, first of all, it will be bigger and better than ever before. The casino is expanding its floor space by 50%, which means that there will be even more games and activities for guests to enjoy. In addition, the casino is investing in new technology and game formats that will make your experience even more exciting.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun night out with friends or family, the Oxford Casino is definitely worth checking out. With its expansion planned for summer 2019, now is definitely the time to get excited! We’ll keep you posted on any updates as they become available, so stay tuned!</p>
<h1 id="When-Will-The-Oxford-Casino-Reopen-10CRIC"><a href="#When-Will-The-Oxford-Casino-Reopen-10CRIC" class="headerlink" title="When Will The Oxford Casino Reopen 10CRIC?"></a>When Will The Oxford Casino Reopen 10CRIC?</h1><p>The Oxford Casino closed its doors in October 2018, after the state of Maine voted to allow casino gambling. The new law permits any municipality with a population of over 10,000 to have a casino.</p>
<p>The question on everyone’s mind is: when will the Oxford Casino reopen 10CRIC?</p>
<p>There is no definitive answer at this time, but we can make some educated guesses.</p>
<p>First, it is important to note that the Oxford Casino is not the only casino affected by the new law. The Hollywood Casino in Bangor is also impacted. It is likely that both casinos will reopen at some point in 2019.</p>
<p>However, it is unclear exactly when that will be. The Hollywood Casino has already announced that it plans to reopen in April 2019. It is possible that the Oxford Casino will follow suit and reopen around the same time.</p>
<p>But there is also a chance that the Oxford Casino could reopen later in the year. There are still a few regulatory hurdles that need to be cleared before it can reopen 10CRIC. So it’s possible that we won’t see a reopening until September or October 2019.</p>
<p>It’s exciting times for casino lovers in Maine! We just have to wait and see when the Oxford Casino will reopen 10CRIC. In the meantime, we can enjoy all of the other great things Maine has to offer!</p>
<h1 id="Oxford-Casino-To-Reopen-10CRIC"><a href="#Oxford-Casino-To-Reopen-10CRIC" class="headerlink" title="Oxford Casino To Reopen 10CRIC"></a>Oxford Casino To Reopen 10CRIC</h1><p>The Oxford Casino will reopen its doors to the public in just a few short days. The casino has been closed for the past few weeks due to some financial troubles, but things are back on track and the casino will reopen with a brand new name and look.</p>
<p>The casino is being renamed 10CRIC, which is an abbreviation for “ten credits”. This new name is meant to signify that the casino is now ready to offer its players top-quality gaming experiences. In addition to the new name, the casino will also be sporting a brand new look, with renovated floors and updated gambling machines.</p>
<p>The casino has already announced that it will be offering a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and craps. In order to celebrate its reopening, the casino is offering a range of promotions that are sure to please players of all levels.</p>
<p>There’s no doubt that 10CRIC will be one of the hottest casinos in town once it reopens later this week. Be sure to check it out and see what all the fuss is about!</p>
<h1 id="10CRIC-In-Oxford-Casino"><a href="#10CRIC-In-Oxford-Casino" class="headerlink" title="10CRIC In Oxford Casino"></a>10CRIC In Oxford Casino</h1><p>The 10CRIC in Oxford Casino is a popular gaming attraction in the city. Visitors can enjoy a range of casino games here, from traditional table games such as roulette and blackjack to modern slots and video poker machines.</p>
<p>The casino is open every day of the week from 11am until late, so there’s plenty of opportunity for gamers to get their fix. In addition to the games floor, there’s also a bar and restaurant for visitors to enjoy. The casino is located in the heart of Oxford and is easily accessible from all corners of the city.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a fun evening out in Oxford, be sure to check out the 10CRIC in Oxford Casino!</p>
<h1 id="Oxford-Casino-Closed-For-10CRIC"><a href="#Oxford-Casino-Closed-For-10CRIC" class="headerlink" title="Oxford Casino Closed For 10CRIC"></a>Oxford Casino Closed For 10CRIC</h1><p>Just days after making a $10 million investment in the casino,<br>Steve Wynn has closed the doors of Oxford Casino for 10 days.<br>In a statement, Wynn Resorts said the closure is due to “circumstances beyond our control.”</p>
<p>The closure comes as a surprise to many, as Oxford Casino was just recently remodeled and given a new name - Twin River Casino.<br>It’s unclear what these “circumstances” are, but some believe they may have something to do with the recent investigation into Steve Wynn’s conduct.</p>
<p>I reached out to Twin River for comment but they declined to respond.</p>
<p>This is certainly not good news for Oxford Casino employees, who are now left without work during the holiday season.<br>Here’s hoping Twin River can get things sorted out quickly and resume normal operations soon.</p>
