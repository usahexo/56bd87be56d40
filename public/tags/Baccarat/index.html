		<h1 id="Hockey-Bettors-Struggle-To-Win-Compared-to-Other-Sports"><a href="#Hockey-Bettors-Struggle-To-Win-Compared-to-Other-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Hockey Bettors Struggle To Win Compared to Other Sports"></a>Hockey Bettors Struggle To Win Compared to Other Sports</h1><p>In any other sport, if you make a bet and lose, it’s your own fault. But in hockey, the debate rages on about whether the betting public or the sportsbooks are to blame when it comes to losing wagers.</p>
<p>For years, hockey bettors have fought an uphill battle trying to win money. They’re up against inflated lines, public interest that often leads to sharp moneyline movements and a lack of information or understanding of how the game is played.</p>
<p>“The betting public has a tendency to overvalue favorites and underestimate underdogs in hockey,” said Benjamin Eckstein, a gambling analyst and author. “This isn’t always the case, but it’s definitely been more pronounced in hockey than in any other sport.”</p>
<p>And underdogs do tend to cover the puck line more often in hockey than they do in other sports. The average margin of victory in NHL games is just 2.8 goals per game, so there’s potential for an upset nearly every time out. In comparison, the NFL sees an average margin of victory of more than 10 points per game, while college basketball sees a margin of nearly 16 points per game.</p>
<p>But even with the potential for more upsets taking place, hockey bettors have still found it difficult to beat the bookies. According to VegasInsider.com, since 2010-11 NHL season when puck lines were first introduced as opposed to moneylines, underdogs have gone 989-1123-77 (48%) against the spread when getting at least +150 on the puck line. That’sassuming you’re betting $100 per game on each underdog - which would result in a $9,989 loss if you were to bet on underdogs exclusively over that span.</p>
<p>“It is harder to win betting on hockey than any other sport,” said Scott Cooley, spokesman for BookMaker.eu “The public loves betting on favorites and because of jersey numbers alone there are usually large wagers placed on teams regardless of their odds.”</p>
<p>Cooley added that because home ice advantage is so important in hockey - with teams winning nearly two-thirds (64%) of their games at home - sportsbooks are quick to adjust their lines accordingly. “In most cases we know what side the general betting public will be on before we even post our opening line,” he said.</p>
<p>So what can you do as a hockey bettor to give yourself the best chance at winning? Here are some tips:</p>
<h1 id="Why-Is-Hockey-Betting-So-Tough-To-Win"><a href="#Why-Is-Hockey-Betting-So-Tough-To-Win" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Hockey Betting So Tough To Win?"></a>Why Is Hockey Betting So Tough To Win?</h1><p>The NHL is a massive, complex league with 31 teams spread across the United States and Canada. With so many games each season - 82 in total - it can be tough to keep track of all the matchups and make informed betting decisions.</p>
<p>Add in the fact that hockey is a low-scoring sport, and it’s no wonder that many bettors struggle to make a profit on hockey betting.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll take a look at some of the key factors you need to consider when betting on hockey, and give you some tips on how to improve your chances of winning.</p>
<h1 id="The-Teams"><a href="#The-Teams" class="headerlink" title="The Teams"></a>The Teams</h1><p>The first thing you need to do when betting on hockey is familiarize yourself with the teams involved. Keep track of their standings, recent results, and injuries/suspensions. This information will help you identify which teams are undervalued by the bookmakers and which teams are overvalued.</p>
<p>For example, if a team is in bad form but still has a strong lineup, they may be worth backing against an opponent who is on a good run but has several injuries. Conversely, if a team is missing several key players through injury or suspension, they may be worth avoiding altogether.</p>
<h1 id="The-Matchups"><a href="#The-Matchups" class="headerlink" title="The Matchups"></a>The Matchups</h1><p>Another important thing to consider when betting on hockey is the matchups between teams. Look at the strengths and weaknesses of each team and try to identify mismatches where one team has an advantage over the other.</p>
<p>For example, if one team is particularly strong offensively but weak defensively, you could back them to win comfortably against a team that is poor offensively but strong defensively. Alternatively, if two evenly matched teams are playing each other, you could look at the odds for both sides to win and back the draw as an outsider bet.</p>
<h1 id="The-Odds"><a href="#The-Odds" class="headerlink" title="The Odds"></a>The Odds</h1><p>When placing bets on any sport, it’s important to make sure you are getting value for your money. This means finding odds that offer a fair chance of winning while also offering an attractive return on investment (ROI).</p>
<p>In hockey, it can be difficult to find good value bets because of the low scoring nature of the sport. However, there are still opportunities to be found if you do your research properly. Try looking for underdog bets that offer generous odds, or backs for high-scoring games where the odds are favourable.</p>
<h1 id="hockey-betting-tougher-to-win-than-football-or-basketball"><a href="#hockey-betting-tougher-to-win-than-football-or-basketball" class="headerlink" title="hockey betting tougher to win than football or basketball?"></a>hockey betting tougher to win than football or basketball?</h1><p>Betting on hockey is one of the tougher sports to win money on, contrary to popular belief. In fact, basketball and football may be a bit easier to handicap since their season schedules are more straightforward.</p>
<p>In the world of hockey betting, there’s a lot more that goes into it than simply looking at a team’s record and trying to determine whether they are going to win or lose. You also have to take player injuries into account, as well as who is currently hot and who is not.</p>
<p>The NHL is a notoriously streaky league, which can make things even more difficult for bettors. Teams can go on long winning streaks or losing streaks, and it’s often difficult to determine whether they are legitimately playing well at the moment or simply getting lucky.</p>
<p>There are also a number of teams in the NHL that are just plain bad, and it can be tough to make money betting on them no matter what the odds might be. Conversely, there are also a few teams that are perennially good but tend to be somewhat overvalued by the oddsmakers.</p>
<p>So how can you make money betting on hockey? The first step is to do your research and try to get a sense of how each team is performing both offensively and defensively. Look at their recent results, but also take into account any major changes (like player injuries) that may have taken place recently. Pay close attention to the lines being offered by the sportsbooks, and only bet when you feel you have a strong edge. Be patient – it often takes time to figure out how to beat the bookies in any sport!</p>
<h1 id="Why-is-hockey-such-a-difficult-sport-to-bet-on"><a href="#Why-is-hockey-such-a-difficult-sport-to-bet-on" class="headerlink" title="Why is hockey such a difficult sport to bet on?"></a>Why is hockey such a difficult sport to bet on?</h1><p>One of the reasons why hockey is a difficult sport to bet on is because of the many different factors that can affect the outcome of a game. For example, injuries to key players, changes in lineups, and weather conditions can all play a role in how a game plays out. Additionally, it can be difficult to predict which team will win or lose a game, as the scores can be very close.</p>
<p>Another reason why hockey is a challenging sport to bet on is because there are not as many games played each season as there are in other sports, such as football or basketball. This means that there is not as much data available to help make informed predictions. In addition, the puck movement in hockey can be difficult to track, which can lead to incorrect betting decisions.</p>
<p>Overall, hockey is a challenging sport to bet on because of the many different factors that can affect the outcome of a game. However, with careful analysis and research it is possible to make successful bets on this sport.</p>
<h1 id="Hockey-Bettors-Face-Tough-Odds-To-Beat-The-Bookies"><a href="#Hockey-Bettors-Face-Tough-Odds-To-Beat-The-Bookies" class="headerlink" title="Hockey Bettors Face Tough Odds To Beat The Bookies"></a>Hockey Bettors Face Tough Odds To Beat The Bookies</h1><p>The National Hockey League is one of the most popular sports in North America, and as a result, betting on hockey games is extremely popular. While there are some bettors who consistently beat the bookies, the odds are stacked against them.</p>
<p>One of the biggest challenges for hockey bettors is that there are so many variables that can affect the outcome of a game. Teams play differently at home and on the road, and different players can be hot or cold on any given night. In addition, teams often make last-minute line changes and goalie substitutions that can impact the outcome of a game.</p>
<p>This makes it difficult to predict how a game will play out, especially if you are betting on a single game rather than a series or matchup. Bettors need to be aware of all of these factors when making their picks, and they also need to have a strong understanding of the betting odds.</p>
<p>The odds for hockey matchups vary depending on which bookie you are using, but they typically range from -115 to +105. This means that a bettor who bets $115 on a team that is favored to win would win $100 if the team does in fact win, while a bettor who bets $100 on a team that is underdog would win $105 if the team wins.</p>
<p>As you can see, these odds provide pretty good value for those who know what they are doing. However, they can also be very tricky to navigate, and there is no guarantee that you will make money by betting on hockey games.</p>
<p>If you are new to betting on hockey, it is advisable to start by betting on matchups instead of single games. This will allow you to spread your risk across several games, and it will also give you more information about how teams play against each other. You can then use this information to make more informed bets when you start betting on single games later on.</p>
<p>Overall, betting on hockey can be profitable if you know what you are doing. But remember that it is not easy to beat the bookies, so always do your research before placing any bets.</p>
