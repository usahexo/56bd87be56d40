Though it’s important to remember that with gambling, there’s always a chance you could lose money. In the US, gambling winnings are subject to federal income taxes.</p>
<p>The amount of tax you pay on your gambling winnings depends on how much you win and what type of gambling it is. Here’s a breakdown:</p>
<p>If you win $1,200 or less in a year from slot machines, bingo, or keno, your winnings are tax-free.</p>
<p>If you win more than $1,200 but less than $5,000 in a year from slot machines, bingo, or keno, your winnings are subject to a 25% tax.</p>
<p>If you win more than $5,000 but less than $10,000 in a year from slot machines, bingo, or keno, your winnings are subject to a 30% tax.</p>
<p>If you win more than $10,000 in a year from any type of gambling, your winnings are subject to a 39.6% tax.</p>
<p>There are also state taxes that may apply to your gambling winnings. For example, in Nevada and New Jersey , there is no state income tax , so all of your gambling winnings would be taxed at the federal level. In Pennsylvania , state income taxes range from 3.07% to 3.49%, so depending on how much you won, part of your prize could be taxed by the state as well as the feds .<br>0</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Calculate-Your-Taxable-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#How-to-Calculate-Your-Taxable-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="How to Calculate Your Taxable Gambling Winnings"></a>How to Calculate Your Taxable Gambling Winnings</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service(I.R.S.) requires taxpayers to report all taxable gambling winnings on their annual tax returns. This article explains the process of how to calculate your taxable gambling winnings and provides helpful examples.</p>
<ol>
<li>Review Publication 529, Miscellaneous Deductions, for a list of deductible gambling expenses.</li>
</ol>
<p>Deductible gambling expenses include:<br>-Losses from wagering transactions<br>-Payments made in connection with playing the Lotteries<br>-The cost of purchasing Lottery tickets<br>-Amounts paid for food, beverages, or hotel rooms while engaged in gambling activity<br>-Transportation costs to and from a gaming establishment<br>-Entertainment expenses incurred while at a gaming establishment<br>2. Gather documentation of your winnings. This includes records such as:<br>-The amount of money or its equivalent won    -The date of the winning bet or wager    -The type of bet or wager    -The name and address of the casino, race track, etc. where the winning occurred<br>3. Subtract any losses from your winnings. You may deduct losses up to the amount of your winnings minus any related expenses you may have had (See step 1). Be sure to have written documentation of your losses as well.<br>4. Determine if you have to report this income on your tax return. Generally, you must report all taxable gambling winnings on Form 1040, line 21. However, there are exceptions; please consult with a tax professional if needed . </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Calculate your net gambling income by subtracting allowable deductions from your gross gambling income . Your net gambling income is subject to federal income tax withholding at 24%. This is calculated on Form W2-G .</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="What-Are-the-Federal-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#What-Are-the-Federal-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What Are the Federal Taxes on Gambling Winnings?"></a>What Are the Federal Taxes on Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the federal agency responsible for collecting taxes on gambling winnings. Gambling income includes, but is not limited to, money or prizes won from casinos, lotteries, horse races and other wagers.</p>
<p>According to the IRS, gambling winnings are taxable income and must be reported on your tax return. The amount of tax you owe depends on your total taxable income and filing status.</p>
<p>For most taxpayers, gambling winnings are considered ordinary income and are taxed at the same rate as other income. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, gambling Winnings that are net of losses are generally not subject to tax. Likewise, certain gambling winnings may be eligible for special tax treatment, such as capital gains or qualified dividends.</p>
<p>In general, you must report all of your gambling winnings on Form 1040, Line 21. This includes cash winnings and the fair market value of any non-cash prizes you receive. If you itemize deductions on your return, you can also claim any applicable gambling losses on Schedule A, Line 28.</p>
<p>The following are some basic guidelines for figuring out how much tax you owe on your gambling winnings:</p>
<p>● Winnings from casino games and slot machines are subject to a federal withholding tax of 25%. This means that $25 will be withheld from every $100 you earn in casino winnings. In most cases, this withholding tax is taken out automatically by the casino when you collect your winnings. However, if you receive a large jackpot that is paid out over several years, you may be required to withhold taxes yourself.</p>
<p>● If you have net winnings of $1,200 or more from bingo or slot machines in a year, the IRS requires you to complete Form W-2G and file it with your tax return. This form reports the amount of your winnings and lists the taxes that were withheld from them.</p>
<p>● Winnings from horseracing and other bets are subject to a federal withholding tax of 15%. So if you earn $100 in horseracing bets in a year, $15 will be withheld for federal taxes. Like casino winnings, this withholding tax is usually taken out automatically by the racetrack or other betting institution when you collect your payouts.</p>
<p>● Lottery wins are generally subject to a federal withholding tax of 24%. This means that $24 will be withheld from every $100 in lottery winnings. However, depending on the state where the lottery is based, there may be other state taxes as well. For example, New York state residents must pay an additional 8% state lottery tax on their winnings. So if you won a million dollar lottery prize in New York City, approximately $240K would go towards state and federal taxes ($240K = ($1M * 24%) – ($1M * 8%))).</p>
<h1 id="When-Do-You-Have-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#When-Do-You-Have-to-Report-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="When Do You Have to Report Gambling Winnings?"></a>When Do You Have to Report Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>Gambling is a popular form of entertainment, but it’s important to know when you need to report your winnings to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The rules for gambling income are different from other types of income, so it’s important to understand what qualifies as gambling income and when it needs to be reported.</p>
<p>Generally, you have to report your gambling winnings on your tax return. However, there are a few exceptions. For example, you don’t have to report winnings from bingo, Keno, or slot machines if the winnings are $5,000 or less per year. You also don’t have to report winnings from a raffle or lottery if the value of the prize is $600 or less.</p>
<p>In addition to reporting your winnings, you also need to report any losses you incurred while gambling. You can deduct these losses from your gambling income, but there are some limitations. For example, you can only deduct losses up to the amount of your gambling income.</p>
<p>It’s important to keep records of your gambling activity so that you can accurately report your income and losses on your tax return. This includes receipts for any payments made (including tickets and entry fees), as well as records of any wins and losses.</p>
<p>If you have questions about how to report your gambling income, please consult a tax professional.</p>
<h1 id="What-Are-the-State-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings"><a href="#What-Are-the-State-Taxes-on-Gambling-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="What Are the State Taxes on Gambling Winnings?"></a>What Are the State Taxes on Gambling Winnings?</h1><p>Most people know that gambling winnings are taxable income, but what are the specific tax rates? And how do they vary based on the state in which you live?</p>
<p>Income from gambling is taxed at the same rate as other income. The tax rates for 2019 range from 10% to 37%, with most taxpayers falling in the 12% to 25% bracket. However, different states have different rules about how gambling income is taxed.</p>
<p>Some states, like Massachusetts and New York, treat all gambling income as taxable income. Other states, like Nevada and South Dakota, exempt some or all gambling winnings from state income taxes. And still other states, like California and Florida, have a hybrid system that taxes some types of gambling income but not others.</p>
<p>Taxpayers who reside in states with no specific rules about gambling income should use the federal rules as a guide. Gambling income is included in your taxable income, and you must report it on your tax return. The IRS has a detailed publication called “Gambling Income and Expenses” which explains these rules in more detail.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that gambling income is taxable in every state, but the specific tax rates and rules vary depending on where you live. So if you hit it big at the casino or race track, be sure to check with your state tax department to find out how much of your winnings will be taxed.</p>
