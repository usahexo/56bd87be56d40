<h1 id="Red-Dressed-Fat-Man-Wants-Your-Slot-Coins-in-Cincinnati-Casino"><a href="#Red-Dressed-Fat-Man-Wants-Your-Slot-Coins-in-Cincinnati-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Red-Dressed Fat Man Wants Your Slot Coins in Cincinnati Casino"></a>Red-Dressed Fat Man Wants Your Slot Coins in Cincinnati Casino</h1><p>The red-dressed fat man was having a great time at the Cincinnati casino this weekend. He seemed to be winning big, and he was clearly enjoying himself. He was also spending a lot of money; there was no doubt about that.</p>
<p>But as he walked around the casino floor, one thing became very clear: He wanted everyone’s slot coins.</p>
<p>He would approach people who were playing slots and try to get them to hand over their coins. Sometimes he would even beg for them. He would say things like, “Come on, just give me your coins. I’m trying to have some fun here.” Or “I really need these coins; can’t you just let me have them?”</p>
<p>It was pretty clear that this guy was a scammer. And while it’s always disappointing to lose your hard-earned money to someone like that, it’s even more frustrating when it happens at a casino.</p>
<p>So if you’re ever in Cincinnati and you see the red-dressed fat man, be sure to keep your slot coins away from him!</p>
