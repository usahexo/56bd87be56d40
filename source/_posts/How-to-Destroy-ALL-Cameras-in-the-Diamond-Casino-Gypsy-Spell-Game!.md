Las Vegas security staff are on high alert this week as a spate of camera vandalism has been reported at the city’s gypsy spell diamond casino. No one has claimed responsibility for the damage, which is estimated to have caused several thousand dollars worth of damage, but casino management believe that the incidents may be linked to a recent gypsy spell diamond casino robbery in which several high-value gaming machines were stolen.

In response to the vandalism, casino management have increased security patrols and are urging anyone with information about the attacks to come forward. They are also offering a generous reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible.
