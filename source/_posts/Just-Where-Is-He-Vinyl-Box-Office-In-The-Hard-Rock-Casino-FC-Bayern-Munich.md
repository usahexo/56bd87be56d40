A box office is a place where tickets are sold to the public for admission to an event or performance. Box offices are typically found in theaters, concert halls, stadiums, and other places where performances or events are held.

There are two types of box offices: primary and secondary. A primary box office is responsible for selling tickets to all events taking place at the venue in which it is located. A secondary box office is responsible for selling tickets only to specific events, not all events that take place at the venue.

If you want to have a good view of the game, then it's important to know where to sit in the stadium.
