Looking for something new to spice up your pizza night? Check out this blackjack supreme pizza! It's a great way to use up all of those toppings you've been itching to try.

Start by preheating your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Then, roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface and place it in a greased baking dish. Spread the sauce over the crust and then top with your favorite toppings.

We recommend using pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, and green peppers. But feel free to get creative and use whatever toppings you like! Once you have everything in place, bake the pizza for about 25 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted.
