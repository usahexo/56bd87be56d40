#  Sushi Ronin owner has Ethiopian wife!

The owner of Sushi Ronin, a popular sushi restaurant in Brooklyn, New York, has an Ethiopian wife. This is something that is not widely known and it is certainly not common in the sushi industry.

Ronin means "samurai without a master" in Japanese and the owner decided to name his restaurant after it because he felt like he was starting his own business from scratch. He is originally from Ethiopia himself but he met his wife while they were both living in Japan.

They have been married for several years now and together they are the proud parents of two young children. His wife is an amazing cook and she has helped him to create some delicious recipes for the menu at Sushi Ronin.

In fact, many of the dishes on the menu are inspired by her traditional Ethiopian cuisine. Some of the most popular items include the spicy beef yorba, the chickenChangingkarma and the crispy sambusa appetizers.

The fact that the owner of Sushi Ronin has an Ethiopian wife is certainly something that sets him apart from other sushi chefs in the industry. It is also something that makes his restaurant unique and (hopefully) attractive to customers who are looking for something a little different.

The Ethiopian wife of a sushi ronin owner has spoken out about her experiences in the United States. She has faced discrimination and bigotry ever since she arrived, but she has persevered and is now thriving in her new home.

“I have experienced a lot of racism since I moved to the US,” she said in an interview. “People have called me all sorts of names and have made fun of my accent. But I’ve refused to let them get to me. I am proud of who I am, and I know that I am just as good as anyone else.”

She went on to say that she was grateful for the opportunities that America had given her. “Despite all the hate and discrimination, America is still a great country. There are so many opportunities here, and I am grateful for every one of them.”

She also spoke about how her husband had supported her throughout it all. “My husband has been my rock throughout all of this. He has always been there for me, and he has never given up on me. I am so lucky to have him by my side.”

The Ethiopian wife of a sushi ronin owner is a testament to the strength and resilience of the human spirit. Despite facing bigotry and discrimination, she has persevered and is now thriving in her new home. We should all be inspired by her story, and we should work to create a society that is inclusive and welcoming for everyone.

I am the owner of sushi ronin, and I am writing in response to the hateful and ignorant comments that have been left on our yelp page. Our restaurant is a place where people of all cultures and backgrounds are welcome, and we proudly serve ethopian cuisine.
