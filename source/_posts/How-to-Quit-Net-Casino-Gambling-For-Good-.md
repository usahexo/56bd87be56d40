Tip #1: Be Honest With Yourself

The first step in quitting net casino gambling is being honest with yourself. If you're not honest about your gambling habits, then it's going to be very difficult to overcome them.

Once you have an accurate idea of your habits, you can start working on ways to change them.

Tip #2: Set Realistic Goals

When it comes to quitting net casino gambling, it's important to set realistic goals. Don't try to go from spending hours every day gambling to suddenly never gambling again. That's just not going to happen. Start small by setting a goal to gamble for a certain amount of time each week or only gamble with a certain amount of money. As you get better at staying away from casinos, slowly increase your goals until you no longer feel the urge to gamble.

Tip #3: Avoid temptation

One of the best ways to quit net casino gambling is by avoiding temptation altogether. This means staying away from any and all forms of gambling, including online casinos, lottery tickets, and sports betting. If there's no way for you to physically gamble, then it will be much harder for you to succumb to temptation. Additionally, try distancing yourself from friends or family members who are big gamblers. This will help reduce the chances of relapse.

#  The Truth About How to Stop Playing on the Net Casino 
sites

We all know how it feels when we get onto our computers, smartphones or
tablets with the sole intent of taking a break from work or studies, but then an hour later realize we've just spent that time browsing our Facebook newsfeeds or YouTube instead. This is even more likely to happen if you're trying to avoid something else, like work, by playing on casino sites. Obviously, this isn't a desirable outcome, and it would be great if we could find a way to stop it from happening. So, what's the answer? Well, here are some tips on how to stop playing on casino sites so that you can get back to productive activities.

1. Disable notifications
One of the main reasons we keep getting drawn back into our casino games is because of the notifications we receive from them. This could be anything from a new high score to seeing that someone has sent us a message. By disabling notifications for these games, we'll be less likely to get drawn back in. On Android devices, you can do this by going into your settings and disabling notifications for the app; for iOS devices, you'll need to go into the game's settings and disable push notifications.

2. Delete the apps/games
If disabling notifications doesn't seem to be working for you, then deleting the apps or games themselves may be a better solution. This way, you'll have to go out of your way to reinstall them if you want to play again, and you're less likely to do so impulsively.

3. Have specific times set aside for playing casino games
If all else fails, try setting specific times of day where you're allowed to play casino games. This will help to restrict your playtime and make it more intentional. Alternatively, try only playing for certain amounts of time each day – once that time limit is up, stop playing no matter what!

#  How to Get Yourself Out of the Rut of Playing on the Net Casino

So how do we break out of this rut and get back to enjoying gambling? Here are a few tips:

- Experiment with different bet amounts: Sometimes all it takes is tweaking your bets a bit in order to reignite your excitement for gambling.

- Take a break: This is definitely something you should consider if you've been feeling uninterested in gambling lately. There's no shame in stepping away from online casinos for awhile in order to recharge your batteries.
